/// Trait for constructing a [`PrimeField`] element from a fixed-length uniform byte

/// "Uniform" means that the byte array's contents must be indistinguishable from the
/// [discrete uniform distribution]. Suitable byte arrays can be obtained:
/// - from a cryptographically-secure randomness source (which makes this constructor
///   equivalent to [`Field::random`]).
/// - from a cryptographic hash function output, which enables a "random" field element to
///   be selected deterministically. This is the primary use case for `FromUniformBytes`.
///
/// The length `N` of the byte array is chosen by the trait implementer such that the loss
/// of uniformity in the mapping from byte arrays to field elements is cryptographically
/// negligible.
///
/// [discrete uniform distribution]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution
///
/// # Implementing `FromUniformBytes`
///
/// [`Self::from_uniform_bytes`] should always be implemented by interpreting the provided
/// byte array as the little endian unsigned encoding of an integer, and then reducing that
/// integer modulo the field modulus.
///
/// For security, `N` must be chosen so that `N * 8 >= Self::NUM_BITS + 128`. A larger
/// value of `N` may be chosen for convenience; for example, for a field with a 255-bit
/// modulus, `N = 64` is convenient as it matches the output length of several common
/// cryptographic hash functions (such as SHA-512 and BLAKE2b).
///
/// ## Trait design
///
/// This trait exists because `PrimeField::from_uniform_bytes([u8; N])` cannot currently
/// exist (trait methods cannot use associated constants in the const positions of their
/// type signature, and we do not want `PrimeField` to require a generic const parameter).
/// However, this has the side-effect that `FromUniformBytes` can be implemented multiple
/// times for different values of `N`. Most implementations of [`PrimeField`] should only
/// need to implement `FromUniformBytes` trait for one value of `N` (chosen following the
/// above considerations); if you find yourself needing to implement it multiple times,
/// please [let us know about your use case](https://github.com/zkcrypto/ff/issues/new) so
/// we can take it into consideration for future evolutions of the `ff` traits.
